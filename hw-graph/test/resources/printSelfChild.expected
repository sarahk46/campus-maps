# Tests that a graph along with a node and an edge to itself can be created.
# Further tests if such edge is printed.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a node
added node n1 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n1(e1)
