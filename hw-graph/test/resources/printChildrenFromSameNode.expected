# Tests that a graph can be created and 5 nodes and 4 edges can be made.
# Additionally tests that all edges are printed.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add 5 nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1
added node n3 to graph1
added node n4 to graph1
added node n5 to graph1

# Add 4 edges
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1
added edge e2 from n1 to n3 in graph1
added edge e3 from n1 to n4 in graph1
added edge e4 from n1 to n5 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1) n3(e2) n4(e3) n5(e4)
