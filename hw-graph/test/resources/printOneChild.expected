# Tests that a graph can be created, a pair of nodes and
# an edge between them can be added, and a single edge can be printed out.

# Create a graph
created graph graph1

# Add a pair of nodes
added node n1 to graph1
added node n2 to graph1

# Add an edge
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in graph1

# Print the outgoing edges from n1
the children of n1 in graph1 are: n2(e1)
