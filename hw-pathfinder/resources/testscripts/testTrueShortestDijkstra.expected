# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# there are multiple edges and two paths to explore.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph
added node C to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 11.000 from A to C in simpleGraph
added edge 2.000 from B to C in simpleGraph

path from A to C:
A to C with weight 11.000
total cost: 11.000
