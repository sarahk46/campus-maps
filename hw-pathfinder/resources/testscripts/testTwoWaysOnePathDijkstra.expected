# Find a path with Dijkstra's algorithm when
# only one path exists for the two nodes, but it goes both ways.
# Checks for this two-way property by changing the ordering of arguments as well.

created graph simpleGraph

added node A to simpleGraph
added node B to simpleGraph

added edge 10.000 from A to B in simpleGraph
added edge 10.000 from B to A in simpleGraph

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000
path from B to A:
B to A with weight 10.000
total cost: 10.000
